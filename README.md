# World Quant University - Capstone Project

>Group 25 June 2020

## Description

The main goal of this research is to understand if GARCH models maintain superior performance in forecasting volatility, despite the high price fluctuations in the financial markets due to extreme shocks such as the one that happened with the COVID-19 phenomena. In this study, we will focus on three different markets: the USA, Germany, and China. To achieve that, we use data composed of daily quotations of the S\&P 500, DAX 30, and SSE, and spanning over a period of 180 days until the 31st of March 2020. The GARCH models' performance will be assessed using loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
